# C++ Hangman Game

## Overview

This C++ Hangman Game was created to develop and demonstrate understanding of C++ syntax and programming concepts. The game implements functions to handle game mechanics such as displaying the hangman, tracking guesses, and determining win or loss conditions. It also involves file handling to load random words and incorporates basic control structures, loops, and conditionals in C++.

The main goal of this project is to gain hands-on experience with fundamental C++ skills, including input/output operations, string manipulation, and random number generation, as well as understanding the structure of a complete C++ program.

## Development Environment

This project was developed using the following tools:

- **IDE:** Visual Studio
- **Language:** C++
- **Libraries:** 
  - `iostream` for handling input and output
  - `vector` to store words
  - `fstream` for file operations (reading a word list)
  - `time.h` to generate a random word each game

## Useful Websites

These websites were helpful during development:

- [cplusplus.com](http://www.cplusplus.com/) - A comprehensive resource for C++ documentation and examples.
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) - A helpful community for troubleshooting specific coding issues.
- [Geeks for Geeks - C++ Programming](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c-plus-plus/) - Contains tutorials and explanations for C++ concepts and syntax.

## Future Work

Improvements and additions planned for future versions include:

- Enhancing the game with a more complex word list
- Adding a difficulty setting with longer or shorter word choices
- Improving the user interface by adding color or a better display format
- Refactoring the code for better readability and efficiency
- Implementing a way to save high scores
